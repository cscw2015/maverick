# Analyzing and Modernizing Victoria City Council's Communications: A Summary for Council

We, a group of five undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science at the University of Victoria, undertook a study of the City of Victoria Council's communications, specifically related to their technology usage. This study was a part of the requirements for a course titled Computer Supported Collaborative Work, under the guidance of Professor Peggy Storey. We interviewed three city councillors from Victoria, the IT manager from the City of Victoria, a concerned citizen who follows Victoria municipal government closely, and for comparison data, the mayor from Sooke. We also attended two city council meetings to obtain additional information, and performed a background literature study of the uses of technology in municipal governments around the world. This document is a condensed version of our full report, titled [Analyzing and Modernizing Victoria City Council's Communications: Final Report] (https://github.com/cscw2015/maverick/blob/master/Final%20Report/final_report.md). Please refer to that document for more detailed information and references to our background literature review. Also note we have included here only the most relevant findings to you in a highly abbreviated form; please refer to the full report for more information.

We decided to interview councillors, as opposed to sending out questionnaires, mostly for time reasons; we were on a limited time frame of about 2 months total, and didn't think we would get as many usable results from questionnaires. Our research questions were:

1. What technologies already exist or are being used to help city councillors in their meetings, with respect to document sharing and communication?
2. What issues are they currently facing with their present technology?
3. How can we improve communication between city councillors?

For technologies that are being used to help city councillors in document sharing and communication, we need to look at the meeting environment and the day-to-day work that each councillor conducts. For meetings, Microsoft Word is displayed on a projector screen to view the agenda or current document. We know that groups that present to the city during the meetings we observed use PowerPoint presentations to share information, but with regards to other document types (e.g. PDFs of reports) we are unsure of how these are being distributed. In day-to-day work, document sharing is facilitated primarily via email, with some councillors using applications like Google Documents only with people that they trust. With respect to communication, councillors primarily use email as a technological medium to interact with each other. Due to the way the city operates, these interactions are fairly limited (as any points that are discussed in detail need to be brought to a meeting environment) so instead councillors interact with their constituents. They do this via email and phone primarily, with a few using Twitter or Facebook to communicate with constituents.

For issues faced with the present technology, please see our recommendations heading. For improving communication between city councillors, this is a misconception that we had when we began our research. We believed that in order to conduct their jobs, councillors needed to collaborate with one another outside of the meeting environment. This is not the case, as the majority of communication that occurs is between councillors and constituents. While the possibility of improving councillor-to-councillor communication still exists (and should eventually be explored) councillors place much more weight on interacting with their constituents. Future research should take a look at this and explore the possibility of improving councillor-to-citizen communication over attempting to improve councillor-to-councillor communication.

It is important before recommendations are made that there is an understanding of why the city of Victoria was chosen as the focus of the study, and why innovating with technology is important. Innovation is an important part of any continued collaborative group work. Walker says innovation is a core task of public institutions and that "innovation has been promoted around the world as a key tool to improve public services" [1]. This is one of the reasons we are targeting the city of Victoria with our study: public services always stand to be improved, and the city is in one of the best positions to affect this change. Ihrke notes that local governments are more likely to innovate than governments at the state or federal level because of "their small size and capacity to make decisions quickly and decisively" [2], and this is another reason as to why we are targeting the city of Victoria. While standards do exist at the provincial and federal level for regulating what technologies can be used in government organizations, municipal governments like the city of Victoria can be more receptive to change and can integrate suggestions for improvement at a much faster pace than provincial or federal bodies. Victoria is also proximal to UVic, which made it easier to interview councillors.

We believe the city of Victoria would be interested in this sort of study for two reasons. The first is that by recognizing any potential shortcomings in current practices you can quickly take steps to remedy these shortcomings; our study offers this through analysis of interviews with city officials. The second reason is that local governments tend to get a lot of pressure to "do more with less" [1], so by offering potential alternatives to the city (should they be applicable), the city can choose to shift the technologies they use and potentially lower their current costs.

### Recommendations

Through the interviews we managed to gain some insight into problems that both councillors and city staff face in their day-to-day operations. Here we go over some of the immediate issues that were presented in the interviews, and some other key points that we felt were problematic (or could be problematic). Some points from observing city council meetings are also brought up in this section, as there are some issues with how the city currently facilitates their meetings.

On preliminary inspection, there is potentially room for improvement at the council’s meetings. Currently the city uses a paper-based solution to keep track of the speaker's list (which councillors are talking and in what order), but this could be improved. One possibility could be some type of system to automate the speaker’s list, perhaps using an app on a smartphone to indicate speaker order as opposed to paper. The city council does employ an app called AgendaNotes that allows for note-taking on the agenda, according to the IT specialist we spoke with, but none of the councillors we interviewed mentioned using this software at meetings. Perhaps more education about the benefits of the software as opposed to paper would aid in adoption of this technology.

One of the first issues that we discovered through our interviews was that the wifi in city council chambers is particularly weak. One councillor noted that it took him a while to download documents during meetings (sometimes 2000+ pages) and that many people had to tether off their iPhones or other smartphones in order to get internet access during city meetings. This type of issue shouldn't be encountered in 2015, and should be addressed sooner rather than later.

However, this point made by the councillor inadvertently raised another key issue that needs to be addressed by the city. Currently the city employs no methods to facilitate file sharing and version control (a topic we explicitly searched for through interviews and through observation) beyond emailing documents back and forth. While the problem of having weak internet to download 2000+ page PDFs during meetings is apparent, one possible fix (that would take more time to implement) would be to set up a file sharing server or a network drive for use in sharing documents. This way, when a councillor enters the building and loads up their device they don't have to go and search for the file to download, wait for the download to complete and then be able to view it, because it's already available to them and is ready to go. Services such as Dropbox exist for this type of purpose, but Dropbox in particular may not be an applicable solution to the city of Victoria due to B.C.'s data privacy laws. Whatever the final solution may be, this should be employed alongside strengthening wifi access in city hall.

Some councillors feel overwhelmed by the volume of email that they have to deal with on a daily basis, and for some individuals it may be overwhelming enough to dissuade them from trying to respond to emails at all. There may be a mismanagement or misallocation of emails between the councillors (some reported getting only 200 emails a day while others are getting up to 1000 a day), but the key issue here is that councillors have no real way of filtering the emails without opening up each one to see if they can respond to it adequately. Some type of email management tool, which filters emails according to actionable items, may be helpful. 

Citizens are starting to feel that the data made available by the city is lacking and that improvements need to be made. The fact that citizens are taking the documents made available by the city and translating them to .json format should be sounding alarms to workers in the city, because this means that the format in which they are offering data isn't being accepted by the public.

One of the final issues that we noted was brought up in passing through one of our interviews. The city of Victoria offers a livestream for viewing their city meetings, and they conduct this through a service called Granicus. While we have not been able to ascertain the quality of the livestreamed video (as it was not the focus of our study) by taking a look at the service used we see room for improvement. When looking at the computer screen of the livestream, there is a large chunk of uneven white space and the video appears to be an afterthought, as it's pushed to a corner of the screen rather than being the main focus of the page. Again, the structure of the website and its usability was not a core part of our research, but keeping the website up to date is an important task for the city.

We hope that this study and its recommendations have offered a different take on the use of technology by Victoria City Council. We genuinely enjoyed meeting with the councillors, and commend Victoria on a well-run and efficient council system. We look forward to future studies and developments that will unearth even more potential improvements for the city. Thank you for reading this report.
