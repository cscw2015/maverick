Analyzing and Modernizing Victoria City Council's Communications: An Interim Report
===================
## Kimberlee Graham-Knight, Roshni Jain, Myan Pamikkar, Nigel Dufty, & Tian Geng
## Introduction

- goal is to discover what methods the city council of Victoria currently uses for collaboration and communication
- includes public council meetings as well as their internal communications
- research questions:
	1. What technologies already exist or are being used to help city councillors in their meetings, for document sharing and communications?
	2. What issues are they currently facing with their present technology?
	3. How can we improve communication between city councillors?
- one area we want to focus on is preparation and management of council meetings via technology
	- what technologies are used to prepare for the meetings
	- how is agenda constructed?
	- how are by-laws introduced, modified and finalized via technology?
	- how is the by-law process made transparent to the public
	- what is used *during* meetings to facilitate and share information?
	- what software is used for remote access to meetings?
- methods of gathering:
	- interviews with city councillors from Victoria
	- smaller number of interviews with Vancouver city councillors (as a control group)
	- attending public council meetings to see what current practices are
- much of existing research about city governments is about how to improve government-citizen relations
	- not as much on how technology plays a role in this, or if there is it's outdated
- we want to focus on inter-governmental collaborations and how city councillors coordinates themselves to solve issues
- research of this type can provide beneficial information to councillors on how to improve their operations, and provide transparency to citizens on how government collates information and develops laws for the city
## Related Work

- goal with section: introduce CSCW usage in other sectors 

### CSCW in Meetings

- according to Sch√ºmmer, 3 distinct facets of designing an electronic face-to-face meeting system: 
	- the peopleware perspective, the design of social processes that are executed by team members,
	- the generic groupware perspective for designing supportive software tools, and
	- the roomware perspective that considers the configuration of artifacts that constitute the tangible meeting space [1]
- factors that influence effectiveness in meetings: motivation and reliability, clear goals, information, context, focus and efficiency, trust and openness, respect, communication, participation and results [1]	
- number of electronic meeting systems currently being used, will only consider two here
- Benyon and Mival note use of blended spaces in some meetings, where technology and physical space are designed in tandem [2]
	- spaces allow for a more ergonomic environment for participants
	- creates increased collaboration opportunities
	- example of blended space using tablets, keyboards, laptops, wall-mounted touchscreens, video-conferencing, ambient lighting [2]

</p>

- Sarda et. al. propose system that engages a real-time feedback system to track speaking behaviours of participants in meetings [3]
	- "talking mannerisms of individiuals play an important factor for meetings to be productive and achieve certain objectives" [3]
	- keeping track of who is talking and when could help meeting run more efficiently
	- Sarda et. al. designed and implemented recording-based system for keeping track of who speak and when, to fairly distribute airtime
<need transition into next section here> 

### Group Dynamics

- important to understand communication dynamics of groups
- important to understand why innovation in public sector is important 
- Victoria operates as mayor-council system, as opposed to council-manager system used in some municipalities [4]
	- gives mayor additional powers; need to do more to understand full powers of mayor
- as Cheyne notes, there are "weak mayors" without veto power and "strong mayors" [5]
<still need to find out about which system Victoria has>
- website for city of Victoria contains a number of documents such as strategic plan and annual reports
- not immediately evident whether it contains information about structure of Victoria city government
	- may need to obtain information through email exchanges with the city
- city council of Victoria is a government entity that can be described as group of people working together
- study of groups has been undertaken for decades
- Poole notes there is always a tension between focusing on group as whole versus individiual members [6]
	- Group members' characteristics interact to produce group characteristics, which forms complex relationship at many levels "which leads to non-independence of individual data" [6]
	- "some members influence each other strongly, whereas others are isolated from the group and exert little influence, and still others are somewhere in between." 
	- complex nature of group dynamics means that any study will need to take into account behaviour of individual and communications of group
- group dynamics change over time
	- example: guest may sit in at council meeting, which may change way members interact
	- most <data> collection methods, which are often done only once in studies, cannot adequately capture full scope of communication
	- to mitigate, our group will attend two consecutive council meetings to note changes between
	- membership of council remains fixed, so do not have to track membership variation
	- council is relatively small; many problems associated with observing communication behaviour of large groups will not be paramount
- Ihkre notes that local governments are more likely to innovate than governments at state or federal level
	- because of "their small size and capacity to make decisions quickly and decisively." [7]
	- according to Haus, "cities hold the potential to construct, articulate and promote common good of their societies by forming policy agendas" [8].
	- potential is there to influence common good with our research by focusing on city council
	- Walker says innovation is a core tasks of public institutions and that "innovation has been promoted around world as a key tool to improve public services" [9].
	- local governments also get a lot of pressure to "do more with less" [9]
	- we will incorporate cost estimate of any changes we may propose in final recommendation report to council
- our methodology will be interview questions posed to city councillors as well as attending meetings
	- Poole notes that group observation and asking questions of individual members are two best ways to obtain group dynamics information
	- specifically recommend in-depth interviews with open-ended questions in order to "obtain symbols that members naturally use to describe their behaviour" [6]
	- interviews may procure false information because what members say may not match behaviour

### CSCW Use in Government and Politics

- as internet usage exploded, public sector realized the need to tap into these new technologies
- three governmental relationships to consider[10]:
	1. **Government to Citizen**: citizens paying bills or taxes, voter registration, business permits and license applications
	2. **Government to Business**: purchase for property, equipment, office supplies
	3. **Government to Government**: our category of concern; includes enabling project teams to collaborate using CSCW technologies, provide news/information and online report generation/procurement tools, publishing documents and manuals online to reduce printing costs[11]
- Stuttgart city council used Cuparla environment in 1998 to improve access to information and collaboration between council members
- designed with aim to support political entities
- supports functions such as information, communication, coordination, collaboration [12]

<img src="https://github.com/cscw2015/maverick/blob/master/Interim/cuparla.jpg">
</p>

- examples of other technologies being used by other municipal governments: 
	- Preston City Council selected Cadcorp SIS desktop & Cadcord GeognoSIS web-based software: provides data migration solution and ability to read/display multiple graphic and database formats [13]
	- Munich City Council replaced all Microsoft software with open source equivalents, saving money on IT costs and proprietary licenses [14]
	- IVS-City Council software used in city council meetings during voting process, done with keypads [15]
- some city councils work with software companies to provide solutions to public-sector requirements
- example: Peterborough City Council working with XCD HR to automate number of manual HR processes [16]
- lets employees take time normally spent on paperwork to focus on more crucial aspects of job
- business benefits include:
	- Immediate benefits/efficiency gains across the board (for HR, managers, and employees)
	- Improved reporting capability with 24/7 up-to-date decision making data available to appropriate audience supporting CMT
	- Improved access to information to support a more mobile workforce using current communication tools: phone, tablet, pc, from anywhere via cloud
	- HR workload has become more manageable and CIPD skills put to better use
	- Less chasing is required due to approval process and email alert reminders on managers and employees [16]

### History of CSCW Use in Government

####Curparla

- Number of socio-tech  projects are coming on a timely manner to improve the city council administration in terms of effective communication by following the below level of practices:
	- the need of technology for support is analysed 
	- then the system is developed
	- then the system is implemented in the organization to serve the particular need.
**Reasons behind to innovate Curparla **
	- Detailed analysis of Stuttgart city council work revealed the certain characteristics as shown below:
		- Any time any place support to council members since they didnít had fix office location to prepare for city-hall meetings.
		- Council members collaborate and behave differently in different contexts. Informal and open within their party groups and were more controlled and formal in official council meetings.
		- No proper structure was followed in communication i.e each member had right to initiate and involve other members of the administration in any order.
		- The usage of computers were not much within the council .
	- Objective of the Curparla Project was
		- To bring effectiveness and flexibility in the work of the councils.
		- To have more access to information by council members
		- To reduce communication barriers between council and administration and within the council.
**Methodology followed **
	- Detailed analysis of council work was done by Needs Driven Analysis .
	- Need for group support was found which served the basis for the Curpala design.
	- Implementation of the design within the council was done as a preliminary level.
	- After few months, the analysis of the Curparla usage was performed in two cycles:
		- In first cycle, the Curparla was tested by 11 city council members . And the results obtained from them are then used to do second analysis , design, implementation and evaluation phase.
		- In the second cycle, this software was test 55 or 56 active city council members.
		- A field test of Curparla was performed on the small city of Kornwestheim to determine the effectiveness of the tool.[17]
**Curparla Software Design**
	- designed with aim to support political entities
	- supports functions such as information, communication, coordination, collaboration
	- Based on the city council actual work procedure, the design consist of  rooms : private room - where the council member works at home, party room - where he collaborates with his party colleagues , a room for committee meetings, a room for work groups, a private post office, and a library for filed information.
	- Documents created in private room can be shared by placing in the corresponding room where he wants to share in.[18]
<Figure of Curparla here>
**Evaluation of Curparla**
	- Curparla was evaluated on five sets of criteria :Cost, Time, Quality , Flexibility and Human Situation  on four levels : Individual, Group, Process  and Organization as shown in the figure [19]

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/massey-tunnel-replacement-project-foi-returns-no-records-1.3303545 <not cited yet>
- needs to be talked about
	- one-off incident? 
	- systemic issue?
- relation to Victoria city government, if any
	- does geographic proximity lead municipal government to allow similar permissions for its council members?

##	Methodology

- collecting data from two main sources
	- primary method is through interviews of city council members
	- secondary method is through observing public city meetings
	- observation provides as a small risk mitigation for first
	- if city official are unable to provide time for interviews, we still have something to work from
- goal is to conduct eight 30 minute interviews 
	- council members to be interviewed decided primarily on availability, since our time for project is limited
	- want to interview six members from Victoria city council as well as two members from city council of Vancouver
	- interviews from Vancouver is to have comparison data with a larger city
- also using public city meetings to observe usage of computers in facilitating meetings, if at all
	- meetings occur every two weeks, held at City Hall in Victoria on Thursdays at 7pm
	- attended two meetings on October 15th and October 29th
	- primary goal with attending these meetings was to observe how meetings were conducted
		- what technology is used to administer and share documents
		- how do they allow for crowd contribution
		- how is discussion moderated and facilitated

<need more transitions>

## Roles And Tasks Division

- previous document didn't highlight what roles each member would focus on in project
- not all members attended city council meetings due to schedule conflicts 
- not all members are conducting interviews due to time constraints and other obligations in the project

####Kimberlee Graham-Knight: Group Leader
- ensure all group members are fulfilling roles
- regularly checks in with group members to answer questions and help resolve issues
- delegation of tasks to other group members as required
- conducting interviews on two city council members
- attendance and observation of city council meetings

####Roshni Jain: Data Analysis
- transcription for interviews once audio files are available
- overseeing analysis of data after transcription
- literature review and background research
- attendance and observation of city council meetings

####Nigel Dufty: Data Collection
- ensures any sensitive information (interview audio logs, transcripts) is kept on an encrypted USB stick
- attendance and observation of city council meetings
- interviews with two city council members

####Tian Geng: Data Analysis
- transcription for interviews once audio files are available
- literature review and background research
- interviews with two city council members

####Myan Panikkar: Editor
- ensures that all written deliverables (namely, reports) are coherent, cohesive and complete
- spearheading writing of consultant report to council
- delegation of report sections and report writing to ensure equitable division of work
- questionnaire/interviews with Vancouver city council members
- attendance and observation of city council meetings

- while everyone has a defined "role" responsibilities do overlap a fair bit in the data collection itself
	- intentional, to make sure everyone working on project has some sort of perspective on city operations

## Impact

- project can immediately offer two things:
1. Outside perspective on current communication practices within the government, which may help identify flaws in communication practices
2. Transparency on communication practices employed by the government, so controversies like the current BC government FOI requests can be avoided
- scale and time frame of project don't allow for in-depth analysis
	- similar studies could be conducted on other municipal governments, provincial governments or even federal
	- larger time frame would allow for observation of different meetings and follow-up interviews

## Preliminary Results

- notes from city meetings here
- small analysis of meetings

## Remaining in Project

- finish interviews with councillors
	- most are scheduled
- transcription of interviews
