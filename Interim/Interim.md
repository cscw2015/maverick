Analyzing and Modernizing Victoria City Council's Communications: An Interim Report
===================
## Group members 

Kimberlee Graham-Knight, Roshni Jain, Myan Panikkar, Nigel Dufty, Tian Geng

## Introduction

- goal is to discover what methods the city council of Victoria currently uses for collaboration and communication
- includes public council meetings as well as their internal communications
- research questions:
	1. What technologies already exist or are being used to help city councillors in their meetings, for document sharing and communications?
	2. What issues are they currently facing with their present technology?
	3. How can we improve communication between city councillors?
- one area we want to focus on is preparation and management of council meetings via technology
	- what technologies are used to prepare for the meetings
	- how is agenda constructed?
	- how are by-laws introduced, modified and finalized via technology?
	- how is the by-law process made transparent to the public
	- what is used *during* meetings to facilitate and share information?
	- what software is used for remote access to meetings?
- methods of gathering:
	- interviews with city councillors from Victoria
	- smaller number of interviews with Vancouver city councillors (as a control group)
	- attending public council meetings to see what current practices are
- much of existing research about city governments is about how to improve government-citizen relations
	- not as much on how technology plays a role in this, or if there is it's outdated
- we want to focus on inter-governmental collaborations and how city councillors coordinates themselves to solve issues
- research of this type can provide beneficial information to councillors on how to improve their operations, and provide transparency to citizens on how government collates information and develops laws for the city

## Related Work

- goal with section: introduce CSCW usage in other sectors 

### CSCW in Meetings

- according to SchÃ¼mmer, 3 distinct facets of designing an electronic face-to-face meeting system: 
	- the peopleware perspective, the design of social processes that are executed by team members,
	- the generic groupware perspective for designing supportive software tools, and
	- the roomware perspective that considers the configuration of artifacts that constitute the tangible meeting space [1]
- factors that influence effectiveness in meetings: motivation and reliability, clear goals, information, context, focus and efficiency, trust and openness, respect, communication, participation and results [1]	
- number of electronic meeting systems currently being used, will only consider two here
- Benyon and Mival note use of blended spaces in some meetings, where technology and physical space are designed in tandem [2]
	- spaces allow for a more ergonomic environment for participants
	- creates increased collaboration opportunities
	- example of blended space using tablets, keyboards, laptops, wall-mounted touchscreens, video-conferencing, ambient lighting [2]
	<insert Figure 2 here>
- Sarda et. al. propose system that engages a real-time feedback system to track speaking behaviours of participants in meetings [3]
	- "talking mannerisms of individiuals play an important factor for meetings to be productive and achieve certain objectives" [3]
	- keeping track of who is talking and when could help meeting run more efficiently
	- Sarda et. al. designed and implemented recording-based system for keeping track of who speak and when, to fairly distribute airtime
<need transition into next section here> 

### Group Dynamics

- important to understand communication dynamics of groups
- important to understand why innovation in public sector is important 
- Victoria operates as mayor-council system, as opposed to council-manager system used in some municipalities [4]
	- gives mayor additional powers; need to do more to understand full powers of mayor
- as Cheyne notes, there are "weak mayors" without veto power and "strong mayors" [5]
<still need to find out about which system Victoria has>
- website for city of Victoria contains a number of documents such as strategic plan and annual reports
- not immediately evident whether it contains information about structure of Victoria city government
	- may need to obtain information through email exchanges with the city
- city council of Victoria is a government entity that can be described as group of people working together
- study of groups has been undertaken for decades
- Poole notes there is always a tension between focusing on group as whole versus individiual members [6]
	- Group members' characteristics interact to produce group characteristics, which forms complex relationship at many levels "which leads to non-independence of individual data" [6]
	- "some members influence each other strongly, whereas others are isolated from the group and exert little influence, and still others are somewhere in between." 
	- complex nature of group dynamics means that any study will need to take into account behaviour of individual and communications of group
- group dynamics change over time
	- example: guest may sit in at council meeting, which may change way members interact
	- most <data> collection methods, which are often done only once in studies, cannot adequately capture full scope of communication
	- to mitigate, our group will attend two consecutive council meetings to note changes between
	- membership of council remains fixed, so do not have to track membership variation
	- council is relatively small; many problems associated with observing communication behaviour of large groups will not be paramount
- Ihkre notes that local governments are more likely to innovate than governments at state or federal level
	- because of "their small size and capacity to make decisions quickly and decisively." [7]
	- according to Haus, "cities hold the potential to construct, articulate and promote common good of their societies by forming policy agendas" [8].
	- potential is there to influence common good with our research by focusing on city council
	- Walker says innovation is a core tasks of public institutions and that "innovation has been promoted around world as a key tool to improve public services" [9].
	- local governments also get a lot of pressure to "do more with less" [9]
	- we will incorporate cost estimate of any changes we may propose in final recommendation report to council
- our methodology will be interview questions posed to city councillors as well as attending meetings
	- Poole notes that group observation and asking questions of individual members are two best ways to obtain group dynamics information
	- specifically recommend in-depth interviews with open-ended questions in order to "obtain symbols that members naturally use to describe their behaviour" [6]
	- interviews may procure false information because what members say may not match behaviour

### CSCW Use in Government and Politics

- as internet usage exploded, public sector realized the need to tap into these new technologies
- three governmental relationships to consider[10]:
	1. **Government to Citizen**: citizens paying bills or taxes, voter registration, business permits and license applications
	2. **Government to Business**: purchase for property, equipment, office supplies
	3. **Government to Government**: our category of concern; includes enabling project teams to collaborate using CSCW technologies, provide news/information and online report generation/procurement tools, publishing documents and manuals online to reduce printing costs[11]
- Stuttgart city council used Cuparla environment in 1998 to improve access to information and collaboration between council members
- designed with aim to support political entities
- supports functions such as information, communication, coordination, collaboration [12]
<image here of Cuparla>
- examples of other technologies being used by other municipal governments: 
	- Preston City Council selected Cadcorp SIS desktop & Cadcord GeognoSIS web-based software: provides data migration solution and ability to read/display multiple graphic and database formats [13]
	- Munich City Council replaced all Microsoft software with open source equivalents, saving money on IT costs and proprietary licenses [14]
	- IVS-City Council software used in city council meetings during voting process, done with keypads [15]
- some city councils work with software companies to provide solutions to public-sector requirements
- example: Peterborough City Council working with XCD HR to automate number of manual HR processes [16]
- lets employees take time normally spent on paperwork to focus on more crucial aspects of job
- business benefits include:
	- Immediate benefits/efficiency gains across the board (for HR, managers, and employees)
	- Improved reporting capability with 24/7 up-to-date decision making data available to appropriate audience supporting CMT
	- Improved access to information to support a more mobile workforce using current communication tools: phone, tablet, pc, from anywhere via cloud
	- HR workload has become more manageable and CIPD skills put to better use
	- Less chasing is required due to approval process and email alert reminders on managers and employees [16]

###History of CSCW Use in Government

####Cuparla

- Number of socio-tech  projects are coming on a timely manner to improve the city council administration in terms of effective communication by following the below level of practices:
	1. the need of technology for support is analysed 
	2. then the system is developed
	3. then the system is implemented in the organization to serve the particular need.

#####Creating Cuparla

- Detailed analysis of Stuttgart city council work revealed certain characteristics as shown below:
	- Any time any place support to council members since they didn't have fixed office location to prepare for city-hall meetings.
	- Council members collaborate and behave differently in different contexts. Informal and open within their party groups and were more controlled and formal in official council meetings.
	- No proper structure was followed in communication; each member had right to initiate and involve other members of the administration in any order.
	- Minimal computer usage within council itself
- Objective of the Cuparla Project was
	- To bring effectiveness and flexibility in the work of the councils.
	- To have more access to information by council members
	- To reduce communication barriers between council and administration and within the council.

#####Methodology used in developing Cuparla

- Detailed analysis of council work was done by Needs Driven Analysis
- Need for group support was found which served the basis for the Cuparla design.
- Implementation of the design within the council was done as a preliminary level.
- After few months, the analysis of the Cuparla usage was performed in two cycles:
	- In first cycle, the Cuparla was tested by 11 city council members
		- results obtained from them are then used to do second analysis, design, implementation and evaluation phase
	- In the second cycle, this software was tested on 55 or 56 active city council members
- A field test of Cuparla was performed on the small city of Kornwestheim to determine the effectiveness of the tool [17]
	
#####Cuparla Software Design

- designed with aim to support political entities
- supports functions such as information, communication, coordination, collaboration
- Based on the city council actual work procedure, the design consist of rooms, shown in figure below: 
	- private room - where the council member works at home 
	- party room - where council member collaborates with their party colleagues
	- room for committee meetings
	- room for work groups
	- private post office
	- library for filed information
- Documents created in private room can be shared by placing in the room they wish to share in [18]

<img src="https://github.com/cscw2015/maverick/blob/master/Interim/cuparla.jpg">
</p>

##### Evaluation of Cuparla

- Cuparla was evaluated on five sets of criteria and four levels of aggregation[19]: 
	- Cost 
	- Time
	- Quality
	- Flexibility
	- Human Situation, further evaluated on: Individual, Group, Process Organization
- criteria and levels of aggregation aligned to create a 4x5 matrix, shown below

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/cscw2015/maverick/blob/master/Interim/Evaluation of Curparla.png">
</p>

- any notes made in eval were attributed only to lowest applicable level
	- e.g. costs of server are attributed to **group**, PC in office is attributed to individual **user**
	- seems to be an effort to reduce redundancy in data from evaluation

####Government 2.0

- Government 2.0 , reflecting the concept of web 2.0 [20] is the extension of the Web 1.0 technologies (which are already been in use by most of the city councils under e-government). 
- Web 2.0 emphasis to e-democracy wherein multimodal, non-hierarchal, collaborative and deliberative networks can be built .
- It emphasize on  more interactive process with the potential use of media for promoting citizen participation . [21]

#####Research strategies followed
 
- The following questions were asked :
	- “Are web 2.0 applications relevant for the government context?
	- If they are, in what way is web 2.0 likely to have an impact on government?
	- How significant could this impact be?
	- How are web 2.0 applications implemented in the government context?”
- To answer the above questions, the below methods are followed:
	- “A web survey of existing innovative web 2.0 initiatives in government-related activities was conducted 
	- A desk-based review of existing web 2.0 applications in the private sector, in order to understand applications that could also have potential for government
	- A set of case studies of existing experiences, based on desk research and interviews with the project managers.”

#####Research Findings:
- The methods followed helped them to find following results:
	- It gave an overview where the web 2.0 technologies can be used
	- How each of the domains could get impacted  through the adoption of web 2.0 applications.

#####Impact of Web 2.0 on Government:
<Figure>
- Here, users are both civil servants and citizens.
	- The centre circle represents group of users who are active in designing and delivering the service. The web 2.0 is used by analysts to create wiki-based intelligence reports in Intellipedia, or citizens creating a new petition online.
	- The second circle represents the group of users who play a fundamental role in ensuring the quality and relevance of content submitted by other users.For example: the rating of evidence submitted to Peer-to-Patent
	- The third circle represents the users who used the web 2.0 applications and get benefitted from the other user’s services.For instance, review on any e-petition by other users helped the users to come up with some decision.
	- The fourth circle represents to those who used the online services to get the quality data without any voluntary engagement.”In the private sector, a classic example is the "most read articles" page in online newspapers”.[22]

### B.C. Government: Current Issues with Transparency
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/bc-government-triple-deleted-e-mails-related-to-the-highway-of-tears/article26969375/ <not cited yet>
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/massey-tunnel-replacement-project-foi-returns-no-records-1.3303545 <not cited yet>
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/privacy-commissioner-alerts-rcmp-after-scathing-report/article26926616/ <not cited yet>

- needs to be talked about
	- is definitely a systemic issue, BC government appears to routinely delete emails it considers "transitory" and responds to freedom of information requests verbally so that there is no written record of the response
	- need to get better systems in place to ensure written records of requests
	- need to limit power of executives in order to ensure important documents to not end up being deleted
- relation to Victoria city government, if any
	- does geographic proximity lead municipal government to allow similar permissions for its council members?

##	Methodology

- collecting data from two main sources
	- primary method is through interviews of city council members
	- secondary method is through observing public city meetings
	- observation provides as a small risk mitigation for first
	- if city official are unable to provide time for interviews, we still have something to work from
- goal is to conduct eight 30 minute interviews 
	- council members to be interviewed decided primarily on availability, since our time for project is limited
	- want to interview six members from Victoria city council as well as two members from city council of Vancouver
	- interviews from Vancouver is to have comparison data with a larger city
- also using public city meetings to observe usage of computers in facilitating meetings, if at all
	- meetings occur every two weeks, held at City Hall in Victoria on Thursdays at 7pm
	- attended two meetings on October 15th and October 29th
	- primary goal with attending these meetings was to observe how meetings were conducted
		- what technology is used to administer and share documents
		- how do they allow for crowd contribution
		- how is discussion moderated and facilitated

<need more transitions> 

## Impact

- project can immediately offer two things:
1. Outside perspective on current communication practices within the government, which may help identify flaws in communication practices
2. Transparency on communication practices employed by the government, so controversies like the current BC government FOI requests can be avoided
- scale and time frame of project don't allow for in-depth analysis
	- similar studies could be conducted on other municipal governments, provincial governments or even federal
	- larger time frame would allow for observation of different meetings and follow-up interviews

## Preliminary Results

- some notes from meetings
	- all councillors are already using laptops/tablets at the meetings
	- start meetings by announcing changes to agenda from when it was published
	- many items on the agenda are "late items"
	- voting is done by simple hand raise
	- councillors indicate they would like to speak by raising hand
	- mayor writes down a list on paper of which councillor(s) are speaking next
	- people presenting give slides to council beforehand
- small analysis of meetings

## Remaining in Project

- finish interviews with councillors
	- most are scheduled
	- will be pursuing people who aren't necessarily city councillors
- transcription of interviews: preliminary data analysis at same time as transcription
- analysis of data

## Appendix 1: Team Roles

####Kimberlee Graham-Knight: Group Leader
Kimberlee is taking on the role of group leader. She is responsible for regularly checking in on each group member to ensure that they are fulfilling their roles and that any issues or questions they have can be addressed as soon as possible. This includes delegating tasks as necessary. Kimberlee is also responsible for conducting some of our interviews with city councillors, and has attended some of the city council meetings to help establish a background for our research. 

####Roshni Jain: Data Analysis
Roshni is responsible for overseeing the analysis of all the data we collect from interviews. As interviews are completed, she and Tian will be transcribing the audio recordings provided from these interviews. After all the transcriptions are completed, Roshni <>. Roshni is also responsible for reviewing any relevant literature and collating the background research necessary to ground this project and give it context. To assist with providing context, Roshni has attended some of the city council meetings. 
####Nigel Dufty: Data Collection
Nigel is responsible for a majority of the data collection involved in the project. He is working with Kimberlee and Tian to organize and conduct interviews of Victoria city council members. To ensure that the audio files from the interviews are kept secure, Nigel is acting as an intermediary for transferring audio from the interviews to Roshni and Tian via an encrypted USB stick. Nigel has also attended city council meetings to help provide context for interviews and for our background research. 

####Tian Geng: Data Analysis
Tian is working with Roshni to create transcriptions of interviews as they are completed. He is also working with Kimberlee and Nigel to conduct interviews of city council members of Victoria. Tian is also responsible for conducting literature review alongside Roshni. 

####Myan Panikkar: Editor
Myan is responsible for all written deliverables in the project. As the primary editor, his job is to ensure that documents needed for the project are coherent, cohesive, and that they are delivered as complete products. This involves some leadership alongside Kimberlee, namely for delegating section content amongst group members as necessary. Myan will also be writing and designing the consultant report that our group intends to deliver to the city council after our interview data has been analyzed. <may do questionnaire for Vancouver still> Myan also attended city council meetings to help provide background research. 

## Appendix 2: Milestones

The following table outlines our previous milestones and our progress on these milestones as of November 4th (when we gave an oral update on our project). Many of our milestones were met successfully, but a few issues arose when we compared our progress to our initial timeline draft. 

### Status on Original Milestones

| Date | Task to Complete | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
|October 15| City Meeting 1 | Finished |
|October 16| Project Proposal Finished | Finished  | 
|October 19| Interview Template Finalized | Finished | 
|October 19| Requests for Interview sent | Pending | 
|October 19| Ethics application complete | Finished | 
|October 29| City Meeting 2 | Finished
|November 4| Oral update on project | Pending |
|November 6| Interviews Completed| Date to be adjusted | 
|November 13| Interim Project Report| Pending |
|December 2| Project Presentation | N/A | 
|December 4| Project Report Finalized | N/A |

One of the more visible issues that can be seen from this table pertains to the interviews. Specifically, we intended to send out requests for interviews on October 19 (when we planned to have our ethics application completed) but we did not complete this until November 4th. While we recognize that our initial deadline was ambitious, leaving our requests for interview until this past week does set us back slightly. Combine this with our increased number of interviews planned and our next deadlines become much stricter. Our new planned date to complete interviews is November 20th. Part of the reason we chose this date pertains to our next issue.

The next issue that this table fails to address is when we plan to have the data from our interviews transcribed. As we plan to do eight interviews in total, transcribing these interviews will take a considerable amount of time. However, we do not have a considerable amount of time available to complete the interviews, transcribe the interviews, interpret their results and propose possible changes to the city's technological setup (if necessary). Currently, we plan to transcribe interviews as we finish. We do need to set a final date for when we want these transcriptions to be complete, so to allow ourselves enough time to analyze the data we chose November 23rd as the final date for interview transcriptions to be completed. 

A third issue that that isn't visible from looking at this table is that we never detailed what would be given to the city council of Victoria as a final deliverable, nor did we state when such a deliverable would be completed and delivered to the city. To address this, we chose to develop a non-academic report to deliver to the city council of Victoria. This report will be less formal in nature and will not contain as many of the academic citations as our final report will, but it will follow a similar structure in order to highlight our findings from the interviews we plan to conduct. 

- may also give a power point presentation on our findings; still in the air 

Given these issues, we made amendments to our timeline from November 4th and beyond. The following table details the changes we previously described in our timeline. 

### New Timeline
| Date | Task to Complete | 
|------|------------------|
|November 4|Requests for Interview sent|
|November 4|Oral update on project|
|November 13|Interim Project Report|
|November 20|Interviews will be Completed|
|November 23|Transcripts will be Completed|
|November 27|Data Analysis will be done|
|December 2|Project Presentation|
|December 4|Final Report|
|December 4|Consultant's Report|
