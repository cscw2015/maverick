### Abstract

Group Maverick is conducting a study of Victoria City Council and their communications, particularly with respect to their usage of technology. We will interview city councillors and/or the mayor of Victoria to determine what their current technology practices are, and write a consultant's report to council of our findings, including recommendations for communications software they may choose to adopt in future. Our proposed approach is to conduct qualitative, semi-structured individual interviews to determine trends and collect data. Then we will analyze this data collectively to determine themes in the answers of the respondents. After analysis of this data, we will be providing a consultant's report to the city of Victoria about software they might consider using, along with costs of the software. This study is being conducted under the auspices of Dr. Storey at the University of Victoria, Canada, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for a course in Computer Supported Collaborative Work.
